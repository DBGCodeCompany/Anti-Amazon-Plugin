# Anti-Amazon-Plugin
A plugin for Firefox that tries to convince the user not to buy at amazon.
Amazon is great, you can literally buy anything you want at amazon. But Amazon isn't fair, the company pays almost no taxes but instead destroys the local retail-market.
This Plugin is for everyone who needs a reminder, whenever one trys to buy something at amazon.
